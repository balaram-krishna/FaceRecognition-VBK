# Face Recognition Project - VBK

This project demonstrates **face recognition** using Python. It can detect and recognize faces from images, annotate them, and display results. The notebook is fully compatible with **Google Colab**, so anyone can run it without installing Python locally.

## ðŸ”¹ Features
- Detect faces in images using `face_recognition` and `OpenCV`
- Recognize known individuals from a reference dataset
- Annotate images with bounding boxes and labels
- Works locally or on Google Colab
